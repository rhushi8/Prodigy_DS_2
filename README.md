First of all comes the data cleaning part.In this I have cleaned the dataset by removing the empty rows.
The data was transformed as per the need of the analysis such as the survival column had values such as 1-for survived and 0-for not survived. A new column which used the 1 and zero and labeled it as survived or not survived was derived.
The unnecessary columns were removed which were not useful for analysis.
The patterns of survival of passengers with respect to age ,port of embarkment,gender was analyzed.
